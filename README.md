# blink
Blink is a file system analyzer for MacOS that provides statistics about your disk usage and an optional cleaning tool as well.

Some statistics that Blink provides:

* How many files are there in my system?
* How much of my disk space is occupied by .jpeg files?
* What are the files that have not been used (modified) in X Months?
* Which unused files should be prioritized on cleaning process?

Blink also provides a CLI to remove the unused files for an easy disk clean up.
