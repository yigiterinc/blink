# blink
Blink is a file system analyzer for MacOS that provides statistics about your disk usage and an optional cleaning tool as well.

Some things you can ask to Blink are: 

* How many files are there in my system?
* How much of my disk space is occupied by images?
* What are the files that have not been used (modified) in X Months?

Blink is also going to provide tools to remove the unused files for an easy disk clean up.
